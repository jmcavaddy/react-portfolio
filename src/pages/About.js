      <p>My name is John McAvaddy. I graduated from Rowan University in 2021 with a bachelors degree in biological sciences and a minor in psychology. Currently, I am a student in the Rutgers Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. I am looking to transition into a career in web development. I have a passion for large projects with complicated parts and I am excited to continue to learn and grow as a developer.</p>

      <p>My interest in computer science flourished in my final semester at Rowan. I enrolled in a class titled "Data Science for Biologists". The class involved processing large datasets with R, drawing conclusions from the results using biological domain knowledge, then preparing presentable reports with Rmarkdown.</p>
